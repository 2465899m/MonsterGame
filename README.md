# MonsterGame
This is a game that was a part of the coursework in the second year module of JP2. This was based on the popular game Pokemon, where when you run the GameWindow class,each of the coloured squares represents an individual Trainer object; the label above the square is the first four characters of the trainer’s name. The trainers used in this program are randomly generated – each has a randomly selected name and a randomly generated set of monsters. The grey squares represent the area they move around, when two trainers enter the green square they battle and the losing trainer goes into the black square, and the name is displayed on the list on the right hand side called 'Eliminated Trainers'.
